Mini-Project 8: JSON
====================

A simple JSON parser.

Implemented by NAME and NAME for CSC-207-01 2023Fa.

Acknowledgements:

* Skeleton code by SamR
* `ChainedHashTable.java` contains in-class work worked with David Rhoades



TO DO:
 -Constants should actually check to see if they are the right words
 -Error checking: braces and brackets should match each other in the stack (check when pushing)
 -Make code look pretty
 -equals() methods are wrong I'm pretty sure
 -documentation?
 -Update Readme with our names, github link, and updated acknowledgements (if needed)
