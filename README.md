Mini-Project 8: JSON
====================

A simple JSON parser.

Implemented by Amelia Vrieze, Tim Yu, and Maya Flynn for CSC-207-01 2024Sp.

Acknowledgements:

* Skeleton code by SamR
* `ChainedHashTable.java` contains in-class work worked with David Rhoades
* `KVPair.java`'s `hashCode()` method taken almost directly from a reading by Professor Osera



TO DO:
 -Constants should actually check to see if they are the right words
 -Error checking: braces and brackets should match each other in the stack (check when pushing)
 -Make code look pretty
 -equals() methods are wrong I'm pretty sure
 -documentation?
 -Update Readme with github link, and updated acknowledgements (if needed)
 -ContainsKey in ChainedHashTable.java could be implemented better
 -getValue in JSONHash returns an iterator. It doesn't appear to cause problems, but we don't know why
